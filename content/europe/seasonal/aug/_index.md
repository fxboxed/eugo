## 2\. Barcelona

Barcelona in August? Yes, please! It's hot, it's lively, and it's packed with things to do. Just be prepared for crowds – everyone else has the same idea. But don't let that deter you; the city's energy is infectious.

**August is peak season, so book everything in advance.** Seriously, everything. Flights, hotels, tours – get it all sorted early to avoid disappointment. You don't want to end up sleeping on the beach (unless that's your thing, of course).

Think about exploring the Gothic Quarter, getting lost in its maze-like streets, and stumbling upon hidden plazas. Or maybe you'd prefer to chill on Barceloneta Beach, soaking up the sun and people-watching.
