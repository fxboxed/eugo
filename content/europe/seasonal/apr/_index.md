Okay, so Amsterdam in April? Seriously, you've picked a _fantastic_ time. The weather's starting to get nice, but it's not swamped with summer tourists just yet. Plus, and this is a big plus, it's tulip season!

**The city basically explodes with color.** You'll find tulips everywhere – in gardens, along the canals, even in people's windowsills. It's pretty magical.

If you're only there for a short time, like a day or two, definitely try to stay somewhere central. That way, you can easily walk to most of the main attractions and wander along those famous canals. Speaking of canals, you absolutely have to take a [canal cruise](https://www.insightvacations.com/blog/amsterdam-in-april/). It's a super chill way to see the city from a different perspective.

Here's a few things you should consider doing:

*   Visit the Tulip Festival: It's a must-see. Gardens and squares all over the city are overflowing with tulips. Seriously, bring your camera.
*   Explore the Canals: Walk, bike, or take a boat tour. You can't go to Amsterdam and not experience the canals.
*   Check out the Museums: The Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum are world-class. If you're into science, NEMO is also a cool option, especially if you're traveling with kids.

> Don't forget to try some local Dutch treats! Cheese tasting is a must, and there are tons of cute cafes where you can grab a coffee and people-watch. If you have extra time, consider a day trip to the Dutch countryside. It's beautiful in the spring.

## 2\. Barcelona, Spain

Barcelona in April? Yes, please! The weather is usually pretty great – not too hot, not too cold, just right for exploring. Plus, it's before the crazy summer crowds hit, so you can actually enjoy the sights without fighting through hordes of tourists. You'll find that _Barcelona_ is a city that comes alive in the spring, with flowers blooming and a general buzz in the air.

**One of the coolest things about visiting Barcelona in April is Sant Jordi's Day on April 23rd.** It's like Valentine's Day, but with books and roses. The streets fill up with stalls selling books and roses, and people exchange them as gifts. It's a really unique and beautiful tradition.

Here are a few things you might want to check out:

*   **Gaudi's Architecture:** You can't go to Barcelona without seeing Gaudi's work. The Sagrada Familia is a must-see, even if you're not usually into churches. Park Güell is another great spot, with its colorful mosaics and quirky designs. It's like stepping into a fairytale.
*   **Las Ramblas:** This famous street is always bustling with activity. It's a great place to people-watch, grab a bite to eat, or just soak up the atmosphere. Just be aware of pickpockets, especially in crowded areas.
*   **Gothic Quarter:** Get lost in the narrow, winding streets of the Gothic Quarter. It's full of history and charm, with hidden squares and ancient buildings. It's a great place to explore on foot.

> Don't forget to try some tapas! Barcelona is known for its delicious food, and tapas are a great way to sample a variety of dishes. Find a local spot away from the main tourist areas for a more authentic experience.

If you're traveling with kids, Barcelona is a fantastic choice. It's a very walkable city, and there are plenty of parks and playgrounds to keep them entertained.

The views of the city from up there are incredible, and there are plenty of little streets and shops to explore. Don't miss Matthias Church and Fisherman's Bastion.
*   Take a stroll along the Danube. The river really is the heart of the city, and there are tons of great spots to walk, bike, or just sit and watch the world go by. Consider a river cruise for a different perspective.
