September is ideal because the summer crowds have thinned out, but the weather is still fantastic. You can explore ancient temples, wander through the charming streets of Valletta, or just chill on the beach. Plus, the [Maltese islands](https://wheresjessieb.com/blog/what-to-know-before-you-travel-to-malta) are super easy to get around, making it a stress-free destination.

But hey, Europe's a big place! If you're looking for other options, consider these:

*   **Croatia**: Think beyond Dubrovnik (which is still awesome, don't get me wrong). Explore the islands, like Hvar or Brac, for a more laid-back vibe. The Dalmatian Coast is gorgeous in September.
*   **Portugal**: Lisbon and Porto are great, but have you thought about the Algarve? The beaches are incredible, and the seafood is to die for. Plus, it's usually less crowded than the major cities.
*   **Greece**: Santorini is iconic, but it can be a zoo in the summer. Consider visiting other Greek islands like Crete or Rhodes. They offer similar beauty with fewer tourists.

> Don't be afraid to venture off the beaten path. Europe has so much to offer beyond the usual suspects. September is the perfect time to explore, with fewer crowds and pleasant weather. Do a little research, find a hidden gem, and create a trip you'll never forget.

And if you're feeling adventurous, why not combine a couple of these destinations? With budget airlines and efficient train systems, it's easier than ever to hop around and experience different cultures in a single trip. _Happy travels!_
