Okay, so you absolutely HAVE to see Vegueta, the old part of the city. _It's a UNESCO World Heritage site_, and it's packed with buildings that are hundreds of years old.

The Catedral de Santa Ana is also pretty impressive, and you can climb to the top for some killer views of the city. Seriously, bring your camera.
