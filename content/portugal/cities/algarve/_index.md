## 1\. Sagres

Sagres, way out on the western edge of the Algarve, is something else. Forget those packed beaches further east; here, it's all about raw nature and a _laid-back_ vibe. **You'll find some of the most dramatic scenery in Portugal.**

Think massive cliffs, powerful waves, and windswept landscapes. It's a surfer's paradise, drawing people from all over Europe. The town itself has a cool, understated feel, a bit rough around the edges, but that's part of its charm.

According to local stories, Prince Henry the Navigator set up his sailing school here way back in the 15th century. They say he taught cartography, ship design, and all that stuff that led to the Age of Discovery. Pretty cool, huh?

If you're up for a short trip, head a few kilometers north to Cabo de São Vicente. It's the southwesternmost point of Europe, with a lonely lighthouse overlooking the wild cape. The views are insane.

> Sagres is perfect if you're into outdoor activities. Surfing, hiking, cycling – you name it. And after a day of exploring, you can chill at one of the terrace bars or restaurants on Rua Comandante Matoso.

Here's a few things you can do in Sagres:

Ria Formosa Natural Park is a must-see! _Stretching over 60 kilometers_, this protected area is a haven of lagoons, islands, and diverse ecosystems. You'll find an amazing array of birdlife, including flamingos, especially during migration seasons.

## 3\. Praia da Marinha

Praia da Marinha is often called one of Portugal's most beautiful beaches, and honestly, it's easy to see why. The dramatic cliffs, the clear water... it's postcard-perfect. You absolutely have to experience it.

**You can spend hours just soaking up the sun and swimming in the refreshing Atlantic.** But there's more to it than just that.

_Snorkeling_ is a popular activity here because the water is so clear. You can see all sorts of cool fish. If you're feeling adventurous, consider exploring the caves and grottoes along the coastline.

There are a few things to keep in mind when you visit. The beach can get pretty crowded, especially during peak season, so it's a good idea to arrive early to snag a good spot. Also, the steps down to the beach are quite steep, so wear comfortable shoes and be prepared for a bit of a climb.

> Don't forget to bring your camera! You'll want to capture the stunning views. Seriously, the photos you take here will be the envy of all your friends. And if you're up for it, consider taking some of the boat trips that leave from nearby beaches. They'll give you a different perspective of the coastline and let you see some hidden gems.

Here's a quick rundown of what you can expect:

*   Incredible views from the clifftops.
*   Clear, inviting water for swimming.
*   Opportunities for snorkeling and exploring caves.
*   Potential crowds during peak season.
*   Steep steps down to the beach.

## 4\. Lagos

Lagos is a town that perfectly blends its rich history with a modern, relaxed vibe. You'll find amazing coastal views, beautiful beaches, and a well-kept historic center all within the old city walls. It's a spot you absolutely have to see when you're in the Algarve.

Beyond the beaches, Lagos has golden cliffs, hidden caves, and clear waters at _Ponta da Piedade_. The old town is full of restaurants, markets, and squares, while the marina has boat trips and places to eat by the water. **It's a great place to spend a day or even longer exploring the sights.**

Here's a few things you can do in Lagos:

*   Explore the historic center and its cobbled streets.
*   Visit Ponta da Piedade for stunning views.
*   Relax on one of the many beaches.

> [Lagos](/portugal/cities/lagos/) is an important city that is steeped in history, and the variety of historical monuments and buildings reflect this varied past. Fascinating buildings include the beautiful Santo Antonio church, the Mercado dos Escravos (Europe’s first slave market) and the charming 17th century Bandeira Fort.

If you're looking to explore beyond Lagos, consider taking some [exciting day trips](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g189111-Activities-Algarve.html) to nearby towns like Silves. You can easily spend half a day wandering through the old town, checking out the traditional houses and the harbor. Not many towns in the Algarve have as many historic buildings, which is why Lagos is a popular day trip.

## 5\. Silves Castle

![Silves Castle with red sandstone walls and blue sky.](https://contenu.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/journalist/f08470f8-b5ec-4d52-87f2-513352a81c3a/thumbnail.jpeg)

Okay, so you're heading to the Algarve and want something beyond beaches? You absolutely have to check out Silves Castle. Seriously, it's a total change of pace and gives you a real feel for the history of the area. It's not just some old pile of rocks; it's a place where you can actually imagine what life was like centuries ago. Plus, the views? Amazing.

**The castle dates way back to the Moorish times**, and you can see the influence in the architecture. The red sandstone walls are super distinctive, and walking along the ramparts makes you feel like you're guarding the city. It's a bit of a climb, but totally worth it for the panoramic views. You can see for miles!

Inside, there are different sections to explore, like the old keep and some residential towers. They even have some exhibitions with artifacts from the Moorish period. It's a cool way to learn about the history without just reading a bunch of boring plaques. I mean, who doesn't love wandering around an old castle?

*   Explore the ramparts for amazing views.
*   Check out the Moorish architecture.
*   Visit the exhibitions inside the castle.

> Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from Silves Castle, but it ended up being one of the highlights of my trip. It's a great way to spend a few hours, especially if you're into history or just want to see something different. Don't forget your camera!

And if you're up for it, consider visiting [Silves](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g189122-Activities-c42-Silves_Faro_District_Algarve.html) itself. It's a charming town with a lot to offer, and the castle is just the beginning. You can easily spend a whole day exploring the area and soaking up the local culture. Trust me, you won't regret it.

## 6\. Benagil Cave

Okay, so Benagil Cave. You've probably seen the pictures, right? That iconic shot of the sunlight streaming through the hole in the ceiling onto the beach inside? Yeah, that's Benagil. And let me tell you, it's even cooler in person. It's one of those places that lives up to the hype, and you absolutely have to see it while you're in the Algarve.

**Getting there is half the adventure.** You can't just stroll up to it; it's only accessible by sea.

Here's the lowdown:

*   **Boat Tours:** These are super popular, and there are tons of companies running tours from nearby beaches like Carvoeiro. They usually include a quick stop at Benagil as part of a larger coastal tour. It's a good option if you want to see a bunch of caves and beaches in one go. You can [book a tour](https://www.earthtrekkers.com/benagil-cave/) to make sure you don't miss out.
*   **Kayaking/SUP:** If you're feeling a bit more adventurous, you can rent a kayak or stand-up paddleboard and paddle to the cave yourself. It's a bit of a workout, especially if the sea is choppy, but it's a really rewarding experience. Plus, you get to explore at your own pace. Just be careful and check the weather conditions before you go!
*   **Swimming:** I wouldn't recommend swimming unless you're a really strong swimmer and the sea is super calm. The currents can be strong, and there are often boats coming and going. Safety first, always.

> Seriously, though, Benagil Cave is a must-see. The scale of the cave is impressive, and the natural light show is just magical. It's one of those places that makes you feel small and insignificant in the best possible way.

Once you're inside, take some time to just soak it all in. The acoustics are amazing, so you'll often hear the sound of the waves echoing around the cave. And of course, snap some photos – you'll want to remember this one. Just be mindful of other people and try not to be _that_ tourist who's hogging the best spot for hours.

## 7\. Vilamoura Marina

![Vilamoura Marina with yachts and palm trees on a sunny day.](https://contenu.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/journalist/077e0015-2e7b-41bf-8745-7de9be0dad2c/thumbnail.jpeg)

Okay, so Vilamoura Marina is definitely one of those places you have to see to believe. It's not just a marina; it's like a whole _lifestyle_. You'll find yourself wandering around, checking out the fancy yachts and soaking up the sun. It's a great spot for people-watching, too.

> Honestly, the vibe there is just different. It's upscale but still relaxed, which is a hard balance to strike. You can easily spend a whole day just chilling, eating, and maybe doing a little shopping.

It's a hub of activity, and you'll find tons to do. Here's a few ideas:

*   Take a [day cruise](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g227947-Activities-Vilamoura_Quarteira_Faro_District_Algarve.html). Seriously, getting out on the water is a must.
*   Grab some food. There are restaurants for every taste.
*   Check out the shops. You might find something special.

**The marina is one of the largest in Europe**, with over 1,000 berths. It's also a venue for events throughout the year, including regattas and art shows. If you're into golf, there are courses nearby, too. And if you want to learn more about the area's history, check out Museu Cerro Da Vila. It's close by and worth a visit.

## 8\. Albufeira

Albufeira, oh Albufeira! You've probably heard the name. It's a pretty popular spot, and for good reason. It's got a bit of everything, making it a solid choice for lots of different travelers. You'll find that Albufeira is a blend of old and new, with a historic center and a bustling tourist scene.

> Albufeira is a great base for exploring other parts of the Algarve. Rent a car, and you can easily visit nearby towns and beaches. Just be prepared for some traffic during peak season. It's worth it, though, to see more of what this region has to offer. Plus, you can find some amazing seafood restaurants away from the main tourist areas.

## 9\. Falésia Beach

Falésia Beach is a must-see! **It's known for its stunning cliffs and golden sands.** You'll find it stretching for over 6 kilometers, offering plenty of space to relax and soak up the sun. The colorful cliffs, with their shades of ochre, rust, and orange, create a truly unique backdrop for your beach day.

It's a popular spot for those looking to unwind in a peaceful setting. The water is usually pretty clear, making it great for a swim. Plus, there are often some nice facilities around, so you can easily spend the whole day there. Just a heads up, _nudist beaches_ are not the main draw here, but it's something to be aware of depending on where you set up camp.

> I went there last summer, and the cliffs were even more impressive in person. The beach was clean, and the water was refreshing. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!

## 10\. Faro Old Town

Okay, so you've made it to the end of the list, and trust me, Faro Old Town is a fantastic way to wrap up your Algarve adventure. It's one of those places where you can just wander around and soak it all in.

**You'll feel like you've stepped back in time** as you walk through the _Arco da Vila_, the neoclassical archway that marks the entrance to the medieval quarter. Seriously, it's like a portal to another era. The cobblestone streets are lined with shops, cafes, and restaurants, so there's always something to catch your eye.

Here's a few things you should check out:

*   The Sé (cathedral): It's been around since the 13th century, and it's got a mix of architectural styles because it was rebuilt after an earthquake. Climb the tower for some killer views of the town. You can also take a [boat trip](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189116-d1102424-Reviews-Old_Town_Faro-Faro_Faro_District_Algarve.html) to explore the Ria Formosa lagoon.
*   Museu Municipal: This domed building used to be the center of the Jewish quarter. Now it's a museum, and it's worth a visit if you're into history.
*   The Walls: Faro Old Town is a walled city, surrounded by protective walls that date back to the 16th century.

> Don't miss the chance to just sit in one of the squares, grab a coffee, and watch the world go by. There's often live music or street performances, which adds to the atmosphere. It's a great way to relax and enjoy the vibe of the Algarve.

Basically, Faro Old Town is a must-see. It's got history, charm, and plenty of things to do. You won't regret spending some time exploring this gem.
