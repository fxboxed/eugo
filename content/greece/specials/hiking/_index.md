### Understanding Local Conditions

Okay, so Greece isn't just one big, sunny paradise all the time.

The weather can change _fast_, especially in the mountains.

**Before you head out, check the forecast.** I mean, really check it.

### Navigating Remote Trails

Some of the best hikes in Greece are way off the beaten path.
