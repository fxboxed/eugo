### Safety Tips

Innsbruck is generally a safe city, but it's always good to be aware of your surroundings. **Keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas like the Old Town and on public transport.** Avoid walking alone in poorly lit areas at night. If you're planning on hiking or skiing, check the weather conditions and be prepared for changing conditions. Make sure you have travel insurance that covers medical emergencies and theft. And it's always a good idea to have a copy of your passport and other important documents stored separately from the originals. Finally, familiarize yourself with the local emergency numbers – police, fire, and ambulance.

> It's worth noting that while Innsbruck is safe, petty theft can occur. Be extra cautious around tourist hotspots and keep your valuables secure.
