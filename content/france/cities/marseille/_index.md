**The basilica itself is stunning.** It's got this Romanesque-Byzantine style, which basically means it's super ornate and beautiful. The outside is covered in colorful stones and mosaics, and there's this huge statue of the Virgin Mary on top. They call her "La Bonne Mère," and she's kind of a symbol of Marseille.
