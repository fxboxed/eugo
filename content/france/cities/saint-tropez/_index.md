It's a small change that makes a big difference. Also, be mindful of your energy consumption in your hotel or rental. Turn off lights and air conditioning when you leave the room.

### Supporting Local Businesses

One of the best ways to travel sustainably is to support the local economy. Instead of going to big chain stores, check out the [local markets](https://www.saltinourhair.com/france/french-riviera-travel-guide/) and smaller shops. Buy souvenirs from local artisans. Eat at family-owned restaurants. This not only helps the community thrive but also gives you a more authentic experience. Plus, you're more likely to find unique and memorable items.

## Getting Around Saint-Tropez

Okay, so you've made it to Saint-Tropez! Now, how do you actually _get around_? Don't worry, it's pretty manageable, even without a car. Here's the lowdown:

### Public Transport Options

Honestly, public transport in Saint-Tropez isn't amazing, but it exists. There are buses, but they can be infrequent, especially outside of peak season. They're useful for getting to nearby towns, but within Saint-Tropez itself, you might find them a bit limiting. If you're arriving by train, remember the closest station is Saint-Raphaël, and you'll need to catch a bus from there. Consider [ferry options](https://niceandbeyond.com/get-around-the-french-riviera/) if you're coming from other coastal cities; it can be a scenic alternative.

### Biking Around Town

**Renting a bike is a fantastic way to explore Saint-Tropez.** It's relatively flat, and you can easily zip between the beaches, the port, and the town center.

You'll discover hidden alleyways, cute shops, and stunning views that you'd miss if you were driving. Plus, you won't have to worry about parking, which can be a nightmare.

> Honestly, ditch the car if you can. Parking is a pain, and the town is small enough to explore on foot or by bike. You'll have a much more relaxed and authentic experience that way. Plus, you'll get some exercise!
