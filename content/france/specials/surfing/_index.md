## Seasonal Surfing Conditions

![Surfers riding waves on a sunny French beach.](/imgs/france/surf-sunny.webp)

### Winter Swells: For Advanced Surfers

Winter in France, from November to March, is when the Atlantic really wakes up.

**The swells are bigger, more powerful, and more consistent.** You'll need a good wetsuit – think 4/3mm or even thicker – plus boots and gloves.

Just be prepared for some seriously cold water!

### Spring: A Transition Period

The big winter swells start to ease off, but there can still be some fun days.

The water is warming up, but you'll still want a wetsuit.

Crowds are generally smaller than in summer, making it a good time to explore different spots.

The swells are less frequent and come from a different direction, but May can be fun.

It's a good time to check the [surf forecasts](https://www.surf-forecast.com/) and be flexible with your plans.

### Summer: Ideal for Beginners

Summer is peak season for a reason.

The waves are smaller and more manageable, making it perfect for beginners and surf schools.

The water is warm, so you can often get away with just a spring suit or even board shorts on warmer days.

Expect crowded beaches, especially in popular spots like Biarritz and Lacanau.

If you're looking to learn to surf or just enjoy some mellow waves, summer is a great time to visit.

The best conditions for beginners are between November and May.

During the warmest months in El Salvador, the water temperature will be around 30 degrees.

During the coldest months, the temperatures will still be around 27 degrees.

## Travel Essentials For Surfing In France

Planning a surf trip to France? Beyond the excitement of catching waves, a little preparation goes a long way.

Here's what you need to consider to make your surfing adventure smooth and enjoyable.

### Getting There: Airports and Transport

France is pretty accessible, with several major airports serving the surf regions.

Flying into Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport (BOD) is a good option for accessing spots like Lacanau and Mimizan.

Biarritz Airport (BIQ) puts you right in the heart of the Basque Country surf scene.

Consider renting a car for flexibility in exploring different breaks, but be aware that parking can be tricky in peak season.

Public transport, like trains and buses, can get you to some coastal towns, but a car really opens up your options.

You could even fly into Spain and drive up to the surf in France from Bilbao.

It’s about a 3 hours drive from Bilbao to Bordeaux and the car rental companies don’t mind that you cross the border into France.

Do you hate border crossing? Bad memories of Mexico? Well, where to grab your coffee and croissant is your greatest worry while traveling between Spain and France, the border crossing is a non-issue, you just drive straight through.

If you do get stopped it will be on the French side at the toll booth.

### Accommodation Options

From budget-friendly hostels to luxurious beachfront hotels, France has something for every surfer's taste and budget.

Hossegor and Biarritz have a wide range of options, but book well in advance, especially if you're traveling during the summer or during surf competitions.

Camping is also a popular choice, with numerous campsites along the coast, offering a more immersive nature experience.

For a more local experience, consider renting an apartment or a room through Airbnb.

**This can give you a taste of French life and often comes with insider tips from your hosts.**

### Local Surf Shops and Rentals

France's surf towns are packed with surf shops where you can buy or rent boards, wetsuits, and other gear.

Renting is a good option if you don't want to lug your own board, or if you want to try different types of boards.

Shops like Ocean Gypsy Surf offer a variety of rentals.

If you're buying, you'll find the same brands as in the US or Australia.

Don't forget essentials like wax, sunscreen, and a repair kit for dings.

Also, consider investing in some [high-quality surfboard racks](https://www.corsurf.com/blogs/news/top-6-winter-2025-travel-essentials) to protect your board during transport.

> Remember to check the condition of rental gear before you hit the water.

A small investment in your own leash and wax can make a big difference in your surfing experience.

Also, be aware of local surf etiquette and respect the ocean and the environment.

## Surfing Events And Competitions

### World Surf League Events

France plays host to some pretty big stops on the [World Surf League](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/world-surf-league-wsl-schedule-calendar) (WSL) calendar.

You've probably heard of the Quiksilver Pro France, usually held in Hossegor.

It's a huge deal, drawing in top surfers from around the globe.

The atmosphere is electric, with crowds packing the beaches to watch pros like Kelly Slater and Gabriel Medina tear it up.

Keep an eye on the WSL schedule to see when the next event is happening, and plan your trip around it for an unforgettable experience.

It's not just about the surfing; it's about the whole vibe – the music, the food, and the excitement of watching the best compete.

### Local Competitions

Beyond the big WSL events, France has a thriving local surf scene.

Smaller, regional competitions happen all along the coast, offering a chance for local surfers to show their skills.

These events are super fun and give you a real taste of the local surf culture.

You'll find them in places like Biarritz, Lacanau, and even some of the smaller Breton towns.

Check out local surf shops or community boards for info on upcoming competitions.

It's a great way to meet people and see some seriously talented surfers who might not be famous yet.

### Surf Festivals

Surf festivals are another awesome way to experience the surf scene in France.

These festivals usually combine surfing with music, art, and other cultural events.

They're a blast for surfers and non-surfers alike.

One example is the Wheels and Waves festival in Biarritz, which blends surfing with motorcycle culture.

You'll find live music, art exhibitions, and of course, plenty of surfing.

These festivals are a great way to immerse yourself in the surf lifestyle and have a good time.

Here's a few things you can expect:

> These events are more than just competitions; they're celebrations of the surf culture and lifestyle.

They offer a unique opportunity to connect with the community, discover new talent, and experience the thrill of surfing in a festive atmosphere.

**Attending a surf event is a great way to enhance your trip.**

## Environmental Considerations For Surfing

### Sustainable Surfing Practices

When you're out there catching waves, think about your impact.

It's easy to get caught up in the thrill, but **keeping our playgrounds clean is super important**.

Here's a few things you can do:

*   Use reef-safe sunscreen.

The chemicals in regular sunscreen can harm coral reefs and marine life.
*   Avoid single-use plastics.

Bring your own water bottle, reusable bags, and containers for snacks.
*   Respect the local environment.

Don't litter, and be mindful of wildlife.

> Surfing is more than just a sport; it's a connection to the ocean.

By adopting sustainable practices, you can help protect the environment for future generations of surfers.

### Protecting Coastal Ecosystems

Coastal ecosystems are fragile, and surfing can have an impact.

_Erosion_ is a big problem, and so is pollution.

You can help by:

*   Supporting organizations that work to protect coastal areas.
*   Participating in beach cleanups.
*   Being aware of the impact of your actions on the environment.

### Community Initiatives

Lots of local communities are working to protect their coastlines.

You can get involved by:

*   Volunteering your time for local conservation projects.
*   Supporting businesses that are committed to sustainability.
*   Educating yourself and others about environmental issues.

It's all about working together to keep our beaches and oceans healthy.

Every little bit helps!

## Exploring Lesser-Known Surf Spots

Sometimes the best surf experiences come from venturing off the beaten path.

France has plenty of _hidden gems_ waiting to be discovered, offering a more secluded and authentic surfing experience.

Let's dive into some of these lesser-known spots.

Getting to these lesser-known spots often requires a bit more effort.

However, the reward is often worth the effort.

Imagine surfing a perfect wave with only a handful of other surfers around, surrounded by stunning natural beauty.

That's the kind of experience you can have when you explore off the beaten path.
