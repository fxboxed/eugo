If the weather is nice, you can hang out in Letna Park for another great view, take a boat ride on the Vltava, or chill in a beer garden. After all, the Czech Republic is famous for its beer!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re there around April 30th, you might catch Witches’ Night, with bonfires and rag effigies. Or, check out the Easter markets in Wenceslas Square and Old Town Square for handmade stuff and local food. You can even take a <a href="https://sidetriptours.com/berlin">day trip to Berlin</a> from Prague.</p>

<li><strong>Explore Montmartre:</strong> Wander through the charming streets of Montmartre, visit the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, and maybe even get your portrait drawn by a local artist. It&rsquo;s touristy, sure, but it&rsquo;s also undeniably charming.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>May is a fantastic time to visit Paris because you get the best of both worlds: pleasant weather and fewer crowds. It&rsquo;s the sweet spot, really. You can enjoy all the iconic sights without feeling overwhelmed, and the city just feels more relaxed and inviting.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re looking for a European getaway in May, Paris should definitely be on your list. You won&rsquo;t regret it!</p>

Plus, the crowds haven&rsquo;t reached peak summer madness yet, so you&rsquo;ll have a slightly easier time elbowing your way to the Trevi Fountain.</p>
<p>May is a sweet spot. You can actually enjoy walking around without feeling like you&rsquo;re in a sauna. The city is buzzing with energy, flowers are blooming, and there&rsquo;s a general sense of <em>joie de vivre</em> in the air. It&rsquo;s pretty contagious, honestly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine strolling through the <a href="/italy/cities/rome">Roman Forum</a>, feeling the history beneath your feet, without battling hordes of tourists.

<h2 id="5-amsterdam-netherlands">5. Amsterdam, <a href="/netherlands/">Netherlands</a></h2>
<p>May in Amsterdam? Yes, please! The weather starts to get nice, and the crowds aren&rsquo;t quite as intense as in the peak summer months. You&rsquo;re in for a treat.</p>
<p><strong>Amsterdam is awesome in May because the tulip fields are in full bloom.</strong> Seriously, it&rsquo;s a sight to behold. Imagine fields of vibrant colors stretching as far as you can see. The best time to catch this spectacle is usually mid-April to mid-May, so you&rsquo;re hitting it just right.</p>
<p>Beyond the tulips, <a href="/netherlands/cities/amsterdam">Amsterdam has a ton to offer</a>. If the weather is good, <em>definitely</em> take a canal cruise. Seeing the city from the water gives you a whole new perspective. Just wandering around the canals and admiring the architecture is a great way to spend an afternoon. The gingerbread-like houses are super charming.</p>
<p>Amsterdam is home to some world-class museums. The Rijksmuseum is a must-see, with its incredible collection of art, including works by Rembrandt. The Van Gogh Museum is another popular choice, and if you&rsquo;re into modern art, check out the Stedelijk Museum. If you&rsquo;re into history, the Anne Frank House is a powerful and moving experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to escape the city for a bit, consider taking a day trip to one of the nearby towns. Utrecht, Haarlem, Leiden, Gouda, Delft, and Rotterdam are all easily accessible by train and offer a different taste of the Netherlands.</p></blockquote>
