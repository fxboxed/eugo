</ul>
<h2 id="1-santorini">1. Santorini</h2>
<p>Okay, so Santorini in August? It&rsquo;s pretty much what you&rsquo;d expect – stunning views, whitewashed buildings, and <em>lots</em> of tourists. But honestly, it&rsquo;s popular for a reason. You&rsquo;re going to be blown away by the sunsets in Oia. Seriously, find a good spot early because everyone else will be trying to do the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>The weather is hot and sunny</strong>, perfect for lounging by the pool or exploring the island. Just remember to pack sunscreen and stay hydrated. You&rsquo;ll probably want to rent a car or scooter to get around, although the buses are an option too. Be warned, though, driving can be a bit chaotic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expect crowds, especially in the main towns like Fira and Oia. Prices for everything, from food to accommodation, will be higher than usual. But if you&rsquo;re prepared for that, Santorini in August can be an unforgettable experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few things you should consider doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a boat tour to the volcano and hot springs.</li>
<li>Visit the Red Beach and Perissa Beach.</li>
<li>Explore the charming village of Pyrgos.</li>
</ul>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to try the local wine! A <a href="https://www.kimkim.com/c/santorini-in-august-travel-tips-weather-and-more">wine-tasting tour</a> is a must.</p>
<h2 id="2-barcelona">2. Barcelona</h2>
<p>Barcelona in August? Yes, please! It&rsquo;s hot, it&rsquo;s lively, and it&rsquo;s packed with things to do. Just be prepared for crowds – everyone else has the same idea. But don&rsquo;t let that deter you; the city&rsquo;s energy is infectious.</p>
<p><strong>August is peak season, so book everything in advance.</strong> Seriously, everything. Flights, hotels, tours – get it all sorted early to avoid disappointment. You don&rsquo;t want to end up sleeping on the beach (unless that&rsquo;s your thing, of course).</p>
<p>Think about exploring the Gothic Quarter, getting lost in its maze-like streets, and stumbling upon hidden plazas. Or maybe you&rsquo;d prefer to chill on Barceloneta Beach, soaking up the sun and people-watching. And, of course, there&rsquo;s the <em>Sagrada Familia</em>, which is a must-see, even if you&rsquo;re not usually into churches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>August is also festival season in Barcelona. Keep an eye out for local celebrations and street parties. They&rsquo;re a great way to experience the city&rsquo;s culture and have some fun.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are some ideas for your trip:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit Park Güell for amazing views and Gaudí&rsquo;s quirky architecture.</li>
<li>Take a stroll down Las Ramblas, but watch out for pickpockets.</li>
<li>Catch a FC Barcelona match if you&rsquo;re a soccer fan.</li>
<li>Indulge in some tapas and sangria – it&rsquo;s practically mandatory.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something a bit different, consider these <a href="https://www.barcelona-life.com/barcelona/things-to-do">unique experiences</a>.</p>
<h2 id="3-amsterdam">3. Amsterdam</h2>
<p>Okay, Amsterdam in August? Yes, please! You&rsquo;re thinking of heading to a city that&rsquo;s basically synonymous with canals, bikes, and a super chill vibe. August is a great time to visit, but be prepared for crowds – everyone else has the same idea.</p>
<p><strong>The weather is usually pretty decent</strong>, think warm days perfect for exploring. But hey, it&rsquo;s still Europe, so pack a light jacket just in case.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rent a bike. Seriously, it&rsquo;s the best way to get around. You&rsquo;ll feel like a local in no time. Just watch out for the trams!</li>
<li>Take a canal tour. It&rsquo;s touristy, sure, but it gives you a totally different perspective of the city. Plus, it&rsquo;s relaxing.</li>
<li>Hit up some museums. The Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum are must-sees, but there are tons of smaller, quirky museums too.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to try some stroopwafels from a street vendor. Trust me on this one. Also, be aware of your surroundings, especially at night. Pickpockets can be a thing in crowded areas. Other than that, just relax and enjoy the city!</p></blockquote>
<p>For a detailed plan, check out this <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/three-days-in-amsterdam/">Amsterdam itinerary</a>.</p>
<h2 id="4-dubrovnik">4. Dubrovnik</h2>
<p>Okay, so Dubrovnik in August? It&rsquo;s gonna be packed. Like, seriously packed. But there&rsquo;s a reason for that – it&rsquo;s gorgeous. The weather is amazing, perfect for swimming in the <em>Adriatic Sea</em>, and the Old Town is just breathtaking. Be prepared for crowds, though. Seriously, plan ahead.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal. You&rsquo;ll be walking the city walls, which is a must-do, but try to go early in the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid the worst of the heat and the tour groups. The views are incredible, though, so it&rsquo;s worth braving the crowds. You can also take a boat trip to Lokrum Island, which is a short ferry ride away and offers a bit of an escape from the city. There are beaches, a monastery, and even peacocks roaming around. It&rsquo;s a nice little day trip.</p>
<p>Food-wise, Dubrovnik has some great restaurants, but they can be pricey, especially in the Old Town. Look for places a bit further out for better deals. Seafood is obviously a big thing here, so try some fresh fish or mussels. And don&rsquo;t forget to try some local wine. <strong>It&rsquo;s a great way to end a long day of sightseeing.</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book your accommodation well in advance. Seriously, do it now.</li>
<li>Be prepared for the heat. Drink lots of water and wear sunscreen.</li>
<li>Consider getting a Dubrovnik Card, which gives you access to some attractions and public transport.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>August is peak season, so expect higher prices and lots of people. But if you&rsquo;re prepared for that, Dubrovnik is an amazing place to visit. The history, the scenery, and the atmosphere are all incredible. Just be patient and enjoy the ride. You can check out this month-by-month guide to see if it&rsquo;s the right time for you.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="5-lisbon">5. Lisbon</h2>
<p>Lisbon in August? Yes, please! You&rsquo;re in for a treat. The city is buzzing with life, the sun is shining, and there&rsquo;s just so much to see and do. Be prepared for some heat, though – it can get pretty toasty. But don&rsquo;t let that deter you; just pack light clothing, sunscreen, and a hat, and you&rsquo;ll be golden.</p>
<p>One of the best <a href="/europe/portugal/cities/lisbon">things about Lisbon</a> is its <em>vibe</em>. It&rsquo;s a city that effortlessly blends old-world charm with modern energy. You can wander through the historic Alfama district, get lost in its narrow, winding streets, and listen to the soulful sounds of Fado music spilling out from the taverns. Or, you can hop on the iconic Tram 28 and take a scenic ride through the city&rsquo;s hills, passing by colorful buildings and stunning viewpoints.</p>
<p><strong>Lisbon is a city that caters to all tastes.</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few things you absolutely must do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit Belém Tower and Jerónimos Monastery, both UNESCO World Heritage sites.</li>
<li>Indulge in a <em>pastel de nata</em> (or several) at Pastéis de Belém.</li>
<li>Explore the vibrant nightlife in the Bairro Alto district.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to take advantage of the many viewpoints (miradouros) scattered throughout the city. They offer breathtaking <a href="portugal/cites/lisbon">panoramic views of Lisbon</a> and the Tagus River. Pack a picnic, grab a bottle of wine, and enjoy the sunset from one of these spots – it&rsquo;s an experience you won&rsquo;t soon forget.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have <a href="https://wheatlesswanderlust.com/3-days-in-lisbon-itinerary/">three days</a>, consider a day trip to Sintra. It&rsquo;s a magical town nestled in the hills, filled with fairytale palaces and lush gardens. It&rsquo;s a perfect escape from the city heat and a chance to explore another side of Portugal.</p>
<h2 id="6-prague">6. Prague</h2>
<p><img src="/imgs/europe/seasonal/aug-1.webp" alt="Prague&rsquo;s Charles Bridge and Castle on a sunny day."></p>
<p>Prague in August? Get ready for a trip back in time! You&rsquo;ll be wandering through streets that look like they&rsquo;re straight out of a fairytale. The Old Town Square is a must-see, especially when the Astronomical Clock puts on its hourly show. It&rsquo;s touristy, sure, but it&rsquo;s also pretty cool to watch.</p>
<p>Charles Bridge is another spot you can&rsquo;t miss. <em>Walking across it</em>, you&rsquo;ll get some amazing views of the Vltava River. Just be prepared for crowds – everyone else wants those views too!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re into something a bit different, check out the <a href="/czechia/cities/prague">Prague</a> Fringe Festival. It&rsquo;s got all sorts of international performances in some really unique spots around the city. You might stumble upon something totally unexpected, which is always fun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to explore Prague Castle and St. Vitus Cathedral. The castle is huge, and the cathedral is just stunning, with all its Gothic details. It&rsquo;s a bit of a climb to get up there, but the views of the city are worth it. Plus, you can say you&rsquo;ve seen one of the biggest ancient castle complexes in the world.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="7-budapest">7. Budapest</h2>
<p>Budapest in August? Absolutely! You&rsquo;re in for a treat. The city is buzzing with energy, and there&rsquo;s so much to see and do. Just be prepared for company – lots of other travelers have the same idea.</p>
<p>August is a great time to visit because the weather is generally warm and sunny, perfect for exploring the city&rsquo;s many outdoor attractions. Plus, there are tons of festivals and events happening, so you&rsquo;ll never be bored. But, it&rsquo;s worth noting that it can get pretty crowded, especially around major tourist spots. So, plan accordingly and maybe book things in advance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to pack light clothing, sunscreen, and comfortable shoes. You&rsquo;ll be doing a lot of walking, and the sun can be intense. Also, consider bringing a reusable water bottle to stay hydrated throughout the day.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest draws in August is the <em>Sziget Festival</em>, a massive music and arts festival that attracts people from all over the world. If you&rsquo;re into music, this is an event you definitely don&rsquo;t want to miss. But even if you&rsquo;re not a festival-goer, there&rsquo;s still plenty to keep you entertained. You can explore the historic Buda Castle, relax in one of the city&rsquo;s famous thermal baths, or take a <a href="https://www.isango.com/theguidebook/the-ultimate-budapest-travel-guide-8-unforgettable-ways-to-explore-the-pearl-of-the-danube/">Danube cruises</a> to see the city from a different perspective.</p>

<p><a href="/uk/cities/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> in August? You&rsquo;re in for a treat! The city is buzzing with energy, mostly thanks to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Just be prepared to share the beach with a few other sunbathers!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This <a href="/france/">french</a> city is buzzing with activity, from street performers to open-air markets. It&rsquo;s a sensory overload in the best way possible.

<p>Don&rsquo;t miss the chance to explore the <a href="https://travel.usnews.com/Valencia_Spain/Things_To_Do/">top attractions in Valencia</a>, from the historic city center to the futuristic City of Arts and Sciences. And of course, make sure to spend some time relaxing on the beach!</p>
<h2 id="11-corfu">11. Corfu</h2>
<p>Corfu in August? Yes, please! You&rsquo;re probably thinking of <a href="/greece/">Greek</a> islands, and <a href="/greece/cities/corfu">Corfu should definitely be on your list</a>. It&rsquo;s not just about the beaches (though they are amazing). There&rsquo;s a lot more to it than that.</p>
<p><a href="/greece/cities/corfu"><em>The island has a rich history</em></a>, influenced by the Venetians, French, and British, which you can see in its architecture and culture.

<h2 id="12-milan">12. Milan</h2>
<p>Milan in August? Okay, hear me out. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking:  fashion capital, business hub, probably deserted in the summer heat. And yeah, some of that&rsquo;s true. But that&rsquo;s also what makes it kind of awesome. You get to see a different side of Milan, one that&rsquo;s a little more relaxed and a lot less crowded. Plus, there are still tons of things to do, especially if you&rsquo;re into art, architecture, or just eating really, really good food.</p>
<p>First off, the crowds are way thinner. That means you can actually enjoy visiting places like the Duomo without fighting your way through hordes of tourists. You can take your time wandering around, soak in the atmosphere, and maybe even snap a decent photo without someone&rsquo;s selfie stick photobombing it. The lines for museums are shorter too, which is always a win. I mean, who wants to spend half their vacation standing in line?</p>
<p>Speaking of museums, Milan has some amazing ones. Pinacoteca di Brera is a must-see, with its incredible collection of Italian art. And of course, there&rsquo;s <em>The Last Supper</em> by Leonardo da Vinci. You&rsquo;ll need to book tickets well in advance, but trust me, it&rsquo;s worth it. Seeing it in person is just breathtaking. You can also explore the <a href="https://www.timeout.com/milan/things-to-do/best-things-to-do-in-milan">best experiences in Milan</a> with fewer tourists around.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about food. Milanese cuisine is seriously underrated. You&rsquo;ve got to try the risotto alla Milanese, with its saffron-infused goodness. And don&rsquo;t even get me started on the gelato. There are gelaterias on practically every corner, each one claiming to have the best gelato in the city. It&rsquo;s your duty to try as many as possible and decide for yourself.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few things to keep in mind if you visit Milan in August:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many locals go on vacation, so some smaller shops and restaurants might be closed. It&rsquo;s always a good idea to check ahead.</li>
<li>It can get pretty hot and humid, so pack light, breathable clothing and stay hydrated.</li>
<li>August is <em>ferragosto</em> in Italy, a traditional holiday period around August 15th. Some businesses might have reduced hours or be closed altogether around this time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Milan in August offers a unique blend of cultural richness and relaxed atmosphere. It&rsquo;s a chance to experience the city at a more leisurely pace, away from the usual tourist frenzy. While some businesses might be closed, the major attractions remain open, and the overall vibe is much more laid-back.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re looking for a <a href="/spain/">Spanish</a> city break that&rsquo;s a little different, give Milan a try in August. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy it.</p>
<h2 id="13-copenhagen">13. Copenhagen</h2>
<p>Copenhagen in August? You&rsquo;re in for a treat! The weather is usually pretty decent, making it perfect for exploring. You&rsquo;ll find the city buzzing with life, and there&rsquo;s a ton to see and do.</p>
<p>One of the best <a href="/denmark/cities/copenhagen">things about Copenhagen</a> is how easy it is to get around by bike. Seriously,as with many regions of <a href="/denmark/">Denmark</a> everyone cycles here. You should definitely rent one and explore the city like a local. You can cruise along the canals, check out the colorful buildings, and just soak in the atmosphere. <strong>It&rsquo;s a super chill way to see the sights.</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few things you might want to check out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tivoli Gardens: It&rsquo;s an amusement park right in the city center. Even if you&rsquo;re not into rides, it&rsquo;s worth a visit just to see the beautiful gardens and the atmosphere.</li>
<li>Nyhavn: This is the iconic harbor with the colorful buildings. It&rsquo;s a great spot for a stroll and maybe grab a beer at one of the many cafes.</li>
<li>The Little Mermaid: Okay, it&rsquo;s a bit touristy, but you can&rsquo;t really go to Copenhagen and not see the Little Mermaid. Just be prepared for crowds.</li>
<li>Rosenborg Castle: If you&rsquo;re into history, this castle is worth a visit. It houses the Danish Crown Jewels and some pretty impressive interiors.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>August is a popular time to visit, so expect some crowds, especially at the main attractions. Booking accommodations and tours in advance is a good idea. Also, keep an eye on the weather forecast, as it can be a bit unpredictable. But overall, Copenhagen in August is a fantastic experience. You&rsquo;ll love the vibrant atmosphere and the laid-back vibe.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re planning a <a href="https://melissmeetsworld.com/copenhagen-itinerary-for-first-timers/">Copenhagen itinerary</a>, make sure to factor in some time to just wander around and get lost in the city. You never know what hidden gems you might find!</p>
