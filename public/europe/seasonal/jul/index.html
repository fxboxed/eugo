<h2 id="11-stockholm">11. Stockholm</h2>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re back in Stockholm! I know, I know, it&rsquo;s on the list twice. But honestly, this city is so amazing in July that it deserves another mention. Think of it as a bonus round of Swedish summer fun.</p>
<p><strong>July in Stockholm is just magical.</strong> The days are long, the sun is (usually) shining, and the city is buzzing with energy. You&rsquo;ve got tons of options, whether you&rsquo;re into exploring <em>historical sites</em>, chilling by the water, or hitting up some cool bars and restaurants.</p>

<h2 id="12-greece">12. Greece</h2>
<p><img src="/imgs/europe/seasonal/jul-3.webp" alt="Beautiful Greek beach with turquoise waters and white buildings."></p>
<p>Okay, Greece in July? You&rsquo;ve got options, my friend. So many islands, so little time. It&rsquo;s hot, it&rsquo;s crowded, but it&rsquo;s also <em>gorgeous</em>. Think whitewashed villages, crystal-clear water, and food that&rsquo;ll make you wanna slap your mama (in a good way, of course).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically signing up for sun-soaked days, balmy nights, and a whole lotta ouzo. Just be prepared to share the experience with, like, half of Europe. Seriously, book ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re into history, Athens is a must. But if you&rsquo;re chasing that island vibe, well, buckle up.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crowds:</strong> July is peak season. Expect lines, packed beaches, and higher prices. If you&rsquo;re not a fan of crowds, maybe consider June or September instead.</li>
<li><strong>Heat:</strong> It&rsquo;s gonna be hot. Like, really hot. Make sure your accommodation has air conditioning, and stay hydrated. Seriously, water is your friend.</li>
<li><strong>Island Hopping:</strong> This is the way to do Greece, in my opinion. Each island has its own unique charm. You can easily <a href="https://www.myshoesabroad.com/which-greek-island-to-visit-from-a-local/">hop between islands</a> and experience a variety of landscapes and cultures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Naxos</strong> might just be the answer. The largest of the Cyclades, its sandy beaches run the gamut from family-friendly frolickers in the west (Agios Prokopios), to the south’s hidden wildlings, where you can ride horses over dramatic dunes (Plaka) or brave powerful winds on a kiteboard (Mikri Vigla). And though not exactly a hidden gem, the pace remains pleasantly drowsy, whether kicking back in beach bars or supping at mountain village tavernas. At the latter, you’ll be drowsier still after generous sloshes of the local plonk.</p>
<h2 id="13-new-zealand">13. New Zealand</h2>
<p>Okay, so New Zealand in July? It&rsquo;s their winter, which might sound crazy when you&rsquo;re thinking about a summer getaway. But hear me out. It could be pretty awesome if you&rsquo;re into <em>skiing</em> or snowboarding.</p>
<p>Coronet Peak, near Queenstown, is where it&rsquo;s at. <strong>It&rsquo;s the oldest ski field in New Zealand</strong>, and they keep the slopes open late. Plus, Queenstown is super close, and the vibe there is just&hellip; energetic. People are all about adventure sports, like bungee jumping. It&rsquo;s kind of their thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not into snow sports, there&rsquo;s still stuff to do. You could check out Auckland, which has some cool eco-friendly hotels. Or, you could just drive around and enjoy the scenery. It&rsquo;s like something out of <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, seriously. Just pack warm clothes, because it gets cold. You can plan a <a href="https://www.earthtrekkers.com/3-week-new-zealand-itinerary-north-south-island-road-trip/">3-week New Zealand itinerary</a> to make the most of your trip.</p>

<ul>
<li>Skiing/Snowboarding at Coronet Peak</li>

Plus, the landscapes are just breathtaking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expect temperatures around 23°C during the day.</li>
<li>Nights can get a bit nippy, especially in Nairobi, so pack a jacket.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s the dry season, so the bush isn&rsquo;t too dense, making it easier to spot animals.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember planning a trip to Kenya, and I was a bit worried about the weather. Turns out, July was perfect. The days were warm, but not too hot, and the evenings were cool and pleasant. It made exploring so much more enjoyable.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Game drives are a must</strong>, and you&rsquo;ll likely see everything from lions and elephants to giraffes and zebras. The Masai Mara is especially incredible during this time of year. You can also visit places like the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust and the Giraffe Centre for some up-close encounters with amazing animals. Don&rsquo;t forget to check out the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g294206-Activities-Kenya.html">Nairobi National Park</a>, where you can see wildlife with the city skyline in the background – it&rsquo;s a pretty surreal experience.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beaches:</strong> From the glamorous shores of Pampelonne in St. Tropez to the more secluded coves near Èze, you&rsquo;re spoiled for choice. Just remember to pack your sunscreen and a good book!</li>

<h2 id="18-dubrovnik">18. Dubrovnik</h2>
<p>Okay, so Dubrovnik in July? It&rsquo;s a classic for a reason. You&rsquo;ve probably seen pictures of the <em>Old Town</em>, all those red roofs against the blue Adriatic. It&rsquo;s pretty much exactly like that, but with way more people. Seriously, be prepared for crowds. But don&rsquo;t let that scare you off completely.</p>
<p><strong>The city walls are a must-do.</strong> Walking around them gives you incredible views, and it&rsquo;s a good way to get your bearings. Just go early in the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid the worst of the heat and the tour groups.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s going to be hot. Like, really hot. Pack light clothes, sunscreen, and a hat.</li>
<li>Book your accommodation well in advance. July is peak season, and places fill up fast.</li>
<li>Consider taking a boat trip to one of the nearby islands. It&rsquo;s a nice escape from the city.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Dubrovnik is beautiful, but it&rsquo;s also a city that&rsquo;s been through a lot. Take some time to learn about its history, especially the recent war. It&rsquo;ll give you a deeper appreciation for the place.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="19-lisbon">19. Lisbon</h2>
<p><img src="/imgs/europe/seasonal/jul-4.webp" alt="Colorful Lisbon streets with tram and river view."></p>
<p>Lisbon in July? Yes, please! You&rsquo;re in for a treat. The city is buzzing with energy, the sun is shining, and there&rsquo;s just so much to see and do.

<ul>
<li><strong>Warm weather:</strong> July is one of the hottest months, so pack accordingly. Think light clothing, sunscreen, and a hat.</li>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Lisbon is a city that rewards exploration. Get lost in the narrow streets of Alfama, ride the iconic Tram 28, and sample the delicious pastries at Pastéis de Belém. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to venture off the beaten path – you never know what hidden gems you might discover.</p></blockquote>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking to escape the city heat, consider a day trip to the beaches of Cascais or Sintra&rsquo;s fairytale castles. You won&rsquo;t regret it!</p>
<h2 id="20-edinburgh">20. Edinburgh</h2>
<p>Okay, so Edinburgh in July? It&rsquo;s pretty awesome. I mean, you&rsquo;ve probably heard about the Fringe Festival, right? It&rsquo;s like the whole city turns into one giant, crazy stage. You&rsquo;ll find street performers, comedians, and all sorts of acts. It&rsquo;s a total blast, but be warned, it gets <em>crowded</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finding a place to stay can be a bit of a nightmare if you don&rsquo;t book way in advance. Seriously, start looking now if you&rsquo;re even thinking about going. Also, pack for all kinds of weather. You might get sunshine, you might get rain, you might get both in the same hour. It&rsquo;s Scotland, after all!</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few things you might want to check out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edinburgh Castle: It&rsquo;s touristy, sure, but it&rsquo;s also pretty cool. The views are amazing.</li>

<h2 id="21-vienna">21. Vienna</h2>
<p>Vienna in July? Yes, please! You might not immediately think of Vienna as a summer destination, but trust me, it&rsquo;s worth considering. The city really comes alive during this time of year, and there&rsquo;s a ton to see and do.</p>
<p>One of the best things about visiting Vienna in July is the weather.

<p>Beyond the main attractions, consider exploring some of Prague&rsquo;s less-known neighborhoods. <em>Žižkov</em>, for example, is a bit rough around the edges, but it&rsquo;s got a great vibe and some fantastic pubs. And if you&rsquo;re into art, check out the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art. It&rsquo;s a bit outside the city center, but it&rsquo;s worth the trip.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>

<p>And don&rsquo;t forget the ruin bars! These unique bars, set in abandoned buildings, are a <em>Budapest</em> staple. Szimpla Kert is the most famous, but there are plenty of others to discover. The nightlife is vibrant, and you&rsquo;ll find something to suit every taste. <strong>Budapest is a city that truly comes alive in the summer.</strong></p>
<h2 id="24-santorini">24. Santorini</h2>

<p>Santorini is a bit of a splurge, but if you&rsquo;re looking for a truly unforgettable experience, it&rsquo;s hard to beat.</p>
