<p>Consider these options for your trip:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lisbon:</strong> <a href="https://myportugalholiday.com/portugal-guides/portugal-in-february.html">Lisbon is recommended</a> over Porto for a February visit, thanks to its milder weather and greater variety of activities and attractions.

<p><strong>Switzerland is best for snowy mountains.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine yourself on a train, watching the <em>snowy</em> landscape roll by. You can hop off in places like Interlaken, Bern, or Geneva. Warm up with some cheese fondue, because, let&rsquo;s be honest, you can never have too much cheese.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Swiss rail system offers some very attractive multi-day excursions in winter. I don&rsquo;t recommend renting a car, since ice and snow can make driving difficult and can slow your travel considerably.</p></blockquote>
