<p><img src="/imgs/europe/adventure/srf-4.webp" alt="Surfers riding waves at Mundaka beach in Europe."></p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;ve probably heard of Mundaka. It&rsquo;s <em>the</em> spot in the Basque Country, Spain, known for its crazy left-hand barrels. <strong>When it&rsquo;s on, it&rsquo;s ON.</strong> But let&rsquo;s be real, it&rsquo;s super fickle. You might spend days waiting for the right swell. But hey, that&rsquo;s part of the adventure, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It requires a very specific swell angle. And that is precisely why so many surfers chase it. When it turns on, it’s a freight train, top-to-bottom left-hand barrel that requires commitment.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what if Mundaka isn&rsquo;t cooperating? Don&rsquo;t worry, the Basque region and beyond have plenty more to offer. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Northern Spain:</strong> Explore other breaks along the coast. There are hidden gems all over, you just need to look for them.</li>
