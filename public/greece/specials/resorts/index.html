<p>It&rsquo;s an island that sparks the imagination and offers something different around every corner.</p>
<h3 id="best-family-friendly-stays-on-santorini">Best Family-Friendly Stays on Santorini</h3>
<p>Finding the right place to stay is key.</p>
<p>While many <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g189433-zff4-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean-Hotels.html">hotels on Santorini</a> cater to couples, there are some real gems for families.</p>
<p>Look for places with family suites or villas, kid-friendly pools, and easy access to amenities.</p>
<p>Consider staying a bit away from the caldera if you have young children, as those areas often involve a lot of stairs.</p>
<p><strong>Apanemo Hotel &amp; Suites</strong> is a great option.</p>
<h3 id="family-activities-in-santorini">Family Activities in Santorini</h3>
<p>Santorini is more than just pretty pictures. Here are some ideas:</p>

<li><strong>Cooking Class:</strong> Learn to make traditional Greek dishes together. Many classes are hands-on and cater to families, even offering special knives for younger children.</li>
<li><strong>Boat Trip:</strong> Take a boat tour around the island, visiting the volcanic islands and swimming in the hot springs. It&rsquo;s a fun way to see the island from a different perspective.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t miss the chance to hike along the caldera. The views are breathtaking, and it&rsquo;s a great way to get some exercise while enjoying the scenery. Pack plenty of water and snacks, and be sure to wear comfortable shoes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Consider visiting a donkey sanctuary – a heartwarming experience for animal lovers.</p>
<h2 id="nafplio-a-historical-coastal-gem">Nafplio: A Historical Coastal Gem</h2>
<p>On the Argolic Gulf, you&rsquo;ll find Nafplio, a port city that might just become a family favorite.</p>
<p>My kids really enjoyed it! Think narrow streets, <em>chic</em> shops, and cafes overflowing with bougainvillea.</p>

<h3 id="best-family-friendly-stays-in-nafplio">Best Family-Friendly Stays in Nafplio</h3>
<p>When I&rsquo;m in Nafplio, I usually pick either Grand Sarai Hotel or Hotel Ippoliti.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both small, boutique hotels right in the historic part of the city.</p>
<p>I suggest checking both because they only have a few rooms that can fit a family of four.</p>
<h3 id="exploring-ancient-ruins-with-kids">Exploring Ancient Ruins with Kids</h3>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t miss the chance to explore the two fortresses: Palamidi Fortress, perched on a hill overlooking the city, and Bourtzi Castle, which seems to float in the gulf.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the coolest things to do is visit the site of a sunken ship! Your guide will lead you along the coastline, over volcanic ash and past sandy beaches, until you reach the Dubai Star, a tanker that ran ashore in 2003.</p>
<p><strong>You can snorkel over the remains and watch the fish darting in and out.</strong></p>

<p>Milos is known for its amazing beaches.</p>
<p>Sarakiniko Beach is a must-see – it&rsquo;s like a moonscape made of white stone formations.</p>
<p>The pumice has been carved by the wind and waves, creating shapes that are fun to explore.</p>
<p>Many of the best beaches are a bit hard to reach, so consider taking a sailboat cruise around the island.</p>
<p>Your captain can recommend the best coves for you to explore.</p>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="best-times-to-visit-for-families">Best Times to Visit for Families</h3>
<p>Figuring out when to go is key.</p>
<p><strong>The shoulder seasons (April-May and September-October) are often ideal.</strong> You&rsquo;ll dodge the intense summer heat and the biggest crowds.</p>
<p>Plus, prices for flights and accommodations tend to be more reasonable.</p>
<p><em>Consider school schedules</em> when making your plans.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re stuck with summer, aim for early June or late August to minimize the chaos.</p>
<p>Many hotels in Greece only have a small number of family suites and adjoining rooms, so plan in advance if you’d like to visit during the <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-family-hotels-in-greece">school holidays</a>.</p>
<h3 id="travel-tips-for-families-in-greece">Travel Tips for Families in Greece</h3>
<p>Traveling with kids requires a bit of extra planning.</p>
<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pack light but smart. Include essentials like sunscreen, hats, and comfortable walking shoes.</li>
<li>Plan for downtime. Kids need breaks, so don&rsquo;t overschedule your days.</li>
<li>Embrace the local culture. Encourage your kids to try new foods and learn a few basic Greek phrases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider renting a car for flexibility, especially if you plan to explore beyond the main tourist areas.</p></blockquote>
<p>Public transportation is available, but a car gives you the freedom to set your own pace.</p>
<p>Also, pre-booking accommodations and tours is highly recommended, especially during peak season.</p>

<li><strong>Activities:</strong> Factor in entrance fees for attractions, tours, and activities.</li>

<p>When planning your family trip to Greece, think about the impact your travels have.</p>
<p>Luckily, more and more resorts are embracing <em>eco-friendly</em> practices.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t just buzzwords; they represent real efforts to minimize environmental impact and support local communities.</p>
<p>Look for certifications like Green Key or Blue Flag, which indicate a commitment to sustainability.</p>
<p>Some resorts go above and beyond, with on-site organic gardens, solar panels, and waste reduction programs.</p>
<p>Choosing these places means you&rsquo;re supporting responsible tourism and teaching your kids about the importance of protecting our planet.</p>
<p>For example, you can find <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g189398-zff24-Greece-Hotels.html">eco-friendly hotels</a> that offer a luxurious stay while minimizing their carbon footprint.</p>
<h3 id="activities-that-promote-sustainability">Activities that Promote Sustainability</h3>
<p>Beyond choosing the right accommodation, the activities you engage in can also make a big difference.</p>
<p>Instead of opting for motorized water sports, try kayaking or paddleboarding.</p>
<p>These activities are not only great exercise but also allow you to appreciate the natural beauty of the Greek coastline without harming it.</p>
<p>Consider visiting local farms or participating in cooking classes that use locally sourced ingredients.</p>
<p>This supports local farmers and reduces the carbon footprint associated with transporting food.</p>
<p>Another great option is to explore national parks and protected areas, learning about the local flora and fauna from knowledgeable guides.</p>

<p>By involving them in sustainable practices, you&rsquo;re not only creating lasting memories but also shaping them into responsible global citizens.</p>
<blockquote>
