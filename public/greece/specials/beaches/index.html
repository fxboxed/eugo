<p>Greece is famous for its amazing beaches, and honestly, picking the <em>best</em> ones is tough because there are so many! But, I&rsquo;ve tried to narrow it down to a few must-see spots.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>
<h3 id="koukounaries-beach-skiathos">Koukounaries Beach, Skiathos</h3>

<h3 id="loggas-beach-corfu">Loggas Beach, Corfu</h3>
<p>Loggas Beach in Corfu is known for its incredible sunsets.</p>
<p>The beach itself is narrow, but the cliffs above offer stunning views.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a climb down, but totally worth it to <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/best-beaches-in-greece-6832990">watch the sunset</a> over the Ionian Sea.</p>
<p>Just be careful near the edge!</p>
<h3 id="dafni-beach-zakynthos">Dafni Beach, Zakynthos</h3>
<p>Dafni Beach in Zakynthos is a protected nesting site for loggerhead sea turtles.</p>
<p>Because of this, it&rsquo;s a really peaceful and unspoiled beach.</p>
<p>You might even see a turtle nest! It&rsquo;s a bit more secluded than some of the other beaches, but that&rsquo;s part of its charm.</p>
<p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The beach is monitored by conservation groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access may be restricted at certain times to protect the turtles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great place for <em>snorkeling</em> and spotting marine life.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into some of the best family-friendly beaches Greece has to offer.</p>
<h3 id="agios-fokas-beach-kos">Agios Fokas Beach, Kos</h3>

<p>The beach is known for its unique volcanic sand, which is darker than your typical white sand, making it a fun novelty for kids.</p>

<p><em>There are also thermal springs nearby</em>, adding a unique element to your beach day.</p>
<p>You can relax in the warm waters while the kids play in the sand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a win-win!</p>
<h3 id="elafonissi-beach-crete">Elafonissi Beach, Crete</h3>
<p>Elafonissi Beach in Crete is famous for its pink sand and shallow turquoise waters.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s like stepping into a postcard!</strong> The water is so shallow that kids can safely wade far out, making it ideal for younger children.</p>
<p>There are also small lagoons and sandbars to explore, providing endless entertainment.</p>
<p>Just be aware that it can get crowded during peak season, so arriving early is a good idea.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget your sunscreen!</p>
<h3 id="paleokastritsa-beach-corfu">Paleokastritsa Beach, Corfu</h3>
<p>Paleokastritsa Beach in Corfu is a bit different, but still great for families.</p>

<h3 id="balos-lagoon-crete">Balos Lagoon, Crete</h3>
<p>Balos Lagoon is like something out of a postcard.</p>
<p>The shallow, turquoise water is perfect for wading, and the pinkish sand is incredibly soft.</p>
<p>It does require a bit of a trek to get there â€“ either a bumpy drive down a dirt road or a boat trip â€“ but that&rsquo;s part of what keeps it relatively secluded.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re there, you&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;ve escaped to your own private paradise.</p>
<p>Just picture yourself relaxing in the warm water, with the sun on your face and not a care in the world.</p>

<p>The iconic rock arch is a must-see, and the beach itself is a great place to relax and soak up the sun.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a similar vibe, but maybe just a <em>tad</em> more accessible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as crazy as Mykonos, but you can still find some fun beach bars and restaurants that stay open late.</p>
<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s a nesting site for loggerhead turtles, so you might even spot one if you&rsquo;re lucky! <strong>It&rsquo;s a great option if you want a mix of relaxation and nightlife.</strong></p>

<p>Look, if you&rsquo;re heading to Greece for the beaches, don&rsquo;t forget about the nightlife. Some of the best parties happen right on the sand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just remember to pace yourself, stay hydrated, and be respectful of the environment.</p>
<p>And maybe learn a few Greek dance moves before you go!</p>
<h2 id="best-beaches-for-snorkeling-and-diving">Best Beaches for Snorkeling and Diving</h2>
<p><img src="/imgs/greece/beaches-aerial.webp" alt="Aerial view of a beautiful beach in Greece."></p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re looking to get your snorkel on, or maybe even strap on some scuba gear? Greece has got you covered.</p>
<p>Forget just sunbathing; let&rsquo;s explore what&rsquo;s <em>underneath</em> those crystal-clear waters.</p>
<p>Here are some top spots where you can see some cool stuff.</p>
<h3 id="shark-bay-alonissos">Shark Bay, Alonissos</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let the name scare you! Shark Bay in Alonissos isn&rsquo;t really about sharks (phew!).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about the amazing underwater visibility and the diverse marine life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the <a href="https://www.moorings.com/blog/best-diving-snorkelling-greece">Alonissos Marine Park</a>, so the ecosystem is super protected, which means you&rsquo;ll see a ton of different fish and maybe even some monk seals if you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>The water is calm, making it perfect for all skill levels.</p>
<p>You can easily spend hours exploring the rocky reefs and seagrass beds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit off the beaten path, which keeps the crowds away, but that also means you might need to rent a boat or take a tour to get there.</p>
<p>Totally worth it for the peace and quiet, and the incredible snorkeling.</p>
<h3 id="keri-beach-zakynthos">Keri Beach, Zakynthos</h3>
<p>Keri Beach in Zakynthos is another gem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known for its caves and rock formations, both above and below the water.</p>
<p>You can take boat tours that will bring you to the best snorkeling spots, including the famous Blue Caves.</p>
<p>The water is incredibly clear, and the sunlight reflecting off the white rocks creates an amazing blue glow.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s a photographer&rsquo;s dream!</strong> Besides the caves, there are also plenty of reefs to explore, teeming with colorful fish and other marine creatures.</p>
<p>Plus, Keri Beach itself is a nice, relaxed place to hang out, with tavernas and cafes where you can grab a bite after your underwater adventures.</p>
<h3 id="agios-nikolaos-beach-lefkada">Agios Nikolaos Beach, Lefkada</h3>
<p>Agios Nikolaos Beach in Lefkada is a great option if you&rsquo;re looking for something a bit more accessible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a well-organized beach with plenty of facilities, including sunbeds, umbrellas, and water sports rentals.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t let that fool you; the snorkeling here is still fantastic.</p>
<p>The water is clear and calm, and there are some interesting rock formations to explore just offshore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good spot for beginners, as the water is shallow and there are lifeguards on duty.</p>
<p>Plus, there are several diving centers nearby if you want to take your exploration to the next level.</p>
<p>After a day of snorkeling, you can relax on the beach and enjoy the beautiful views of the surrounding coastline.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snorkeling and diving in Greece offer a unique way to experience the beauty of the islands.</p></blockquote>
<p>The clear waters and diverse marine life make it an unforgettable adventure.</p>
<p>Remember to always respect the environment and follow responsible tourism practices.</p>

<h2 id="unique-beaches-with-stunning-landscapes">Unique Beaches with Stunning Landscapes</h2>
<p>Greece isn&rsquo;t just about beaches; it&rsquo;s about <em>experiences</em>.</p>
<p>Some beaches stand out not just for their sand and water, but for the sheer, raw beauty of their surroundings.</p>
<p>Get ready to have your breath taken away.</p>
<h3 id="elafonissi-beach-crete-1">Elafonissi Beach, Crete</h3>
<p>Elafonissi is famous for its pink sand and shallow, turquoise waters.</p>
<p><strong>The unique color comes from crushed seashells, creating a surreal and unforgettable landscape.</strong> It&rsquo;s more like a lagoon than a typical beach, making it perfect for families with small children.</p>
<p>You can easily wade across to the island, exploring the natural reserve and enjoying the views.</p>
<p>It can get crowded, especially in peak season, so plan to arrive early to secure your spot.</p>
<h3 id="simos-beach-elafonisos">Simos Beach, Elafonisos</h3>
<p>Located on the tiny island of Elafonisos, Simos Beach is often ranked among the best beaches in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually two beaches, Mikros Simos and Megalos Simos, separated by a narrow strip of sand.</p>
<p>The water is incredibly clear and shallow, ideal for swimming and snorkeling.</p>
<p>The sand dunes behind the beach add to the wild, natural feel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a journey to get there, but the reward is well worth the effort.</p>
<p>Consider these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ferry from the mainland is frequent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Camping is popular, but regulated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring your own shade, as natural shade is limited.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kleftiko-beach-milos">Kleftiko Beach, Milos</h3>
<p>Kleftiko, also known as &ldquo;Bandits&rsquo; Hideout,&rdquo; is a collection of stunning rock formations and sea caves on the southwest coast of Milos.</p>
<p>You can only reach it by boat, which adds to its secluded and adventurous feel.</p>
<p>The crystal-clear water is perfect for swimming and snorkeling, and the rock formations provide a dramatic backdrop.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.awaylands.com/story/9-best-beaches-in-milos-greece-the-most-beautiful-greek-island">Milos beaches</a> are truly unique.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a must-see if you&rsquo;re visiting Milos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kleftiko isn&rsquo;t your typical sandy beach. It&rsquo;s an experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Swimming through the caves, exploring the rock formations, and soaking in the history of this former pirate hideout is something you won&rsquo;t soon forget.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/greece/beaches-view.webp" alt="Aerial view of a beautiful Greek beach with turquoise water."></p>
<h3 id="best-times-to-visit">Best Times to Visit</h3>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re dreaming of Greece, right? Picture this: sun-soaked beaches, crystal-clear water&hellip;</p>
<p>but timing is <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The absolute best time to hit the Greek beaches is during the shoulder seasons: late spring (May-June) or early fall (September-October).</strong> You&rsquo;ll dodge the crazy summer crowds and the scorching heat, plus the water is still warm enough for a good swim.</p>
<p>July and August? Beautiful, sure, but expect packed beaches and higher prices.</p>
<p>Plus, you might feel like you&rsquo;re sharing your towel with half of Europe.</p>
<p>Not ideal, trust me.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-pack-for-the-beach">What to Pack for The Beach</h3>
<p>Packing for a Greek beach trip is pretty straightforward, but here&rsquo;s the lowdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen! Seriously, the Greek sun is no joke. Go for a high SPF and reapply often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A good hat and sunglasses are a must. Protect your face and eyes from that intense sunshine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lightweight beach towel or sarong. Quick-drying is your friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swimsuit (obviously!), and maybe a cover-up for when you&rsquo;re grabbing lunch at a taverna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flip-flops or sandals. Easy to slip on and off, and perfect for navigating sandy shores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reusable water bottle. Stay hydrated, people!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A waterproof bag to protect your phone and other valuables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget a good book or your favorite playlist! Beach time is relaxation time, after all. And maybe a small first-aid kit, just in case.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="local-cuisine-to-try">Local Cuisine to Try</h3>
<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s talk food! You can&rsquo;t go to Greece without indulging in some amazing local dishes.</p>
<p>Here are a few must-tries:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Souvlaki</em>: Grilled meat skewers, usually served in a pita with tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki. A classic!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Horiatiki Salata</em>: The famous Greek salad. Fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, olives, and feta cheese, drizzled with olive oil. Simple but delicious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Seafood</em>: Freshly caught fish and seafood are abundant in Greece. Try grilled octopus, fried calamari, or a seafood risotto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tzatziki</em>: A creamy dip made from yogurt, cucumber, garlic, and dill. Perfect with pita bread or as a side dish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Spanakopita</em>: A savory pie filled with spinach and feta cheese. A great snack or light meal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, don&rsquo;t forget to wash it all down with some local wine or ouzo! Cheers to that!</p>
