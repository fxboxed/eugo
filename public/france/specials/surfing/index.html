<h2 id="seasonal-surfing-conditions">Seasonal Surfing Conditions</h2>
<p><img src="/imgs/france/surf-sunny.webp" alt="Surfers riding waves on a sunny French beach."></p>
<h3 id="winter-swells-for-advanced-surfers">Winter Swells: For Advanced Surfers</h3>
<p>Winter in France, from November to March, is when the Atlantic really wakes up.</p>
<p><strong>The swells are bigger, more powerful, and more consistent.</strong> You&rsquo;ll need a good wetsuit – think 4/3mm or even thicker – plus boots and gloves.</p>
<p>The weather can be unpredictable, with big waves often mixed with closeouts and strong winds.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re an experienced surfer looking for a challenge, the deserted lineups and powerful waves can be worth it.</p>
<p>Just be prepared for some seriously cold water!</p>
<h3 id="spring-a-transition-period">Spring: A Transition Period</h3>
<p>Spring is a bit of a mixed bag.</p>
<p>The big winter swells start to ease off, but there can still be some fun days.</p>
<p>The water is warming up, but you&rsquo;ll still want a wetsuit.</p>
<p>Crowds are generally smaller than in summer, making it a good time to explore different spots.</p>
<p>The swells are less frequent and come from a different direction, but May can be fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good time to check the <a href="https://www.surf-forecast.com/">surf forecasts</a> and be flexible with your plans.</p>
<h3 id="summer-ideal-for-beginners">Summer: Ideal for Beginners</h3>
<p>Summer is peak season for a reason.</p>
<p>The waves are smaller and more manageable, making it perfect for beginners and surf schools.</p>
<p>The water is warm, so you can often get away with just a spring suit or even board shorts on warmer days.</p>
<p>Expect crowded beaches, especially in popular spots like Biarritz and Lacanau.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to learn to surf or just enjoy some mellow waves, summer is a great time to visit.</p>
<p>The best conditions for beginners are between November and May.</p>
<p>During the warmest months in El Salvador, the water temperature will be around 30 degrees.</p>
<p>During the coldest months, the temperatures will still be around 27 degrees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summer is a different place with topless girls and bronzed Italians, in winter the only thing topless will be your red wine bottle.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="travel-essentials-for-surfing-in-france">Travel Essentials For Surfing In France</h2>
<p>Planning a surf trip to France? Beyond the excitement of catching waves, a little preparation goes a long way.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to consider to make your surfing adventure smooth and enjoyable.</p>
<h3 id="getting-there-airports-and-transport">Getting There: Airports and Transport</h3>
<p>France is pretty accessible, with several major airports serving the surf regions.</p>
<p>Flying into Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport (BOD) is a good option for accessing spots like Lacanau and Mimizan.</p>
<p>Biarritz Airport (BIQ) puts you right in the heart of the Basque Country surf scene.</p>
<p>Consider renting a car for flexibility in exploring different breaks, but be aware that parking can be tricky in peak season.</p>
<p>Public transport, like trains and buses, can get you to some coastal towns, but a car really opens up your options.</p>
<p>You could even fly into Spain and drive up to the surf in France from Bilbao.</p>
<p>It’s about a 3 hours drive from Bilbao to Bordeaux and the car rental companies don’t mind that you cross the border into France.</p>
<p>Do you hate border crossing? Bad memories of Mexico? Well, where to grab your coffee and croissant is your greatest worry while traveling between Spain and France, the border crossing is a non-issue, you just drive straight through.</p>
<p>If you do get stopped it will be on the French side at the toll booth.</p>
<h3 id="accommodation-options">Accommodation Options</h3>
<p>From budget-friendly hostels to luxurious beachfront hotels, France has something for every surfer&rsquo;s taste and budget.</p>
<p>Hossegor and Biarritz have a wide range of options, but book well in advance, especially if you&rsquo;re traveling during the summer or during surf competitions.</p>
<p>Camping is also a popular choice, with numerous campsites along the coast, offering a more immersive nature experience.</p>
<p>For a more local experience, consider renting an apartment or a room through Airbnb.</p>
<p><strong>This can give you a taste of French life and often comes with insider tips from your hosts.</strong></p>
<h3 id="local-surf-shops-and-rentals">Local Surf Shops and Rentals</h3>
<p>France&rsquo;s surf towns are packed with surf shops where you can buy or rent boards, wetsuits, and other gear.</p>
<p>Renting is a good option if you don&rsquo;t want to lug your own board, or if you want to try different types of boards.</p>
<p>Shops like Ocean Gypsy Surf offer a variety of rentals.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re buying, you&rsquo;ll find the same brands as in the US or Australia.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget essentials like wax, sunscreen, and a repair kit for dings.</p>
<p>Also, consider investing in some <a href="https://www.corsurf.com/blogs/news/top-6-winter-2025-travel-essentials">high-quality surfboard racks</a> to protect your board during transport.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember to check the condition of rental gear before you hit the water.</p></blockquote>
<p>A small investment in your own leash and wax can make a big difference in your surfing experience.</p>
<p>Also, be aware of local surf etiquette and respect the ocean and the environment.</p>
<h2 id="surfing-events-and-competitions">Surfing Events And Competitions</h2>
<h3 id="world-surf-league-events">World Surf League Events</h3>
<p>France plays host to some pretty big stops on the <a href="https://www.redbull.com/us-en/world-surf-league-wsl-schedule-calendar">World Surf League</a> (WSL) calendar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of the Quiksilver Pro France, usually held in Hossegor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge deal, drawing in top surfers from around the globe.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is electric, with crowds packing the beaches to watch pros like Kelly Slater and Gabriel Medina tear it up.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the WSL schedule to see when the next event is happening, and plan your trip around it for an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the surfing; it&rsquo;s about the whole vibe – the music, the food, and the excitement of watching the best compete.</p>
<h3 id="local-competitions">Local Competitions</h3>
<p>Beyond the big WSL events, France has a thriving local surf scene.</p>
<p>Smaller, regional competitions happen all along the coast, offering a chance for local surfers to show their skills.</p>
<p>These events are super fun and give you a real taste of the local surf culture.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find them in places like Biarritz, Lacanau, and even some of the smaller Breton towns.</p>
<p>Check out local surf shops or community boards for info on upcoming competitions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great way to meet people and see some seriously talented surfers who might not be famous yet.</p>
<h3 id="surf-festivals">Surf Festivals</h3>
<p>Surf festivals are another awesome way to experience the surf scene in France.</p>
<p>These festivals usually combine surfing with music, art, and other cultural events.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a blast for surfers and non-surfers alike.</p>
<p>One example is the Wheels and Waves festival in Biarritz, which blends surfing with motorcycle culture.</p>

<h3 id="sustainable-surfing-practices">Sustainable Surfing Practices</h3>
<p>When you&rsquo;re out there catching waves, think about your impact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the thrill, but <strong>keeping our playgrounds clean is super important</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few things you can do:</p>

</ul>
<p>Bring your own water bottle, reusable bags, and containers for snacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Respect the local environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t litter, and be mindful of wildlife.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surfing is more than just a sport; it&rsquo;s a connection to the ocean.</p></blockquote>
<p>By adopting sustainable practices, you can help protect the environment for future generations of surfers.</p>

<p>You can help by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting organizations that work to protect coastal areas.</li>
<li>Participating in beach cleanups.</li>
<li>Being aware of the impact of your actions on the environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="community-initiatives">Community Initiatives</h3>
<p>Lots of local communities are working to protect their coastlines.</p>
<p>You can get involved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteering your time for local conservation projects.</li>
<li>Supporting businesses that are committed to sustainability.</li>
<li>Educating yourself and others about environmental issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about working together to keep our beaches and oceans healthy.</p>
