<li>Budget: Set a budget for your villa rental and stick to it.</li>

<h2 id="packing-essentials-for-family-vacations">Packing Essentials for Family Vacations</h2>
<p><img src="/imgs/france/families-pool.webp" alt="Family having fun at a French resort in summer."></p>
<h3 id="clothing-for-varying-weather">Clothing for Varying Weather</h3>
<p>Okay, so France in 2025&hellip; you&rsquo;re gonna need layers. Seriously.</p>
<p>Think light t-shirts, a <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Travel-Safety-Tips.aspx">waterproof bag</a>, a sweater or fleece, and maybe even a light jacket.</p>
<p>Even in summer, evenings can get cool, especially if you&rsquo;re near the coast.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re heading to the mountains, definitely pack some warmer stuff.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget swimwear, because, well, France! <em>Versatility</em> is key here.</p>
<h3 id="comfortable-footwear">Comfortable Footwear</h3>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;ll be doing a lot of walking, trust me.</strong> Cobblestone streets are charming, but they&rsquo;re not exactly foot-friendly.</p>
<p>Pack comfortable sneakers or walking shoes.</p>
<p>If you plan on doing any hiking, bring appropriate hiking boots.</p>
<p>Sandals or flip-flops are good for the beach or pool, but not ideal for exploring cities or villages.</p>
<p>Maybe pack two pairs of walking shoes, just in case one gets wet or uncomfortable.</p>
<h3 id="sun-protection-and-safety">Sun Protection and Safety</h3>
<p>France can get surprisingly sunny, especially in the south.</p>
<p>Sunscreen is a must, even on cloudy days.</p>
<p>Hats and sunglasses are also important for protecting yourself from the sun.</p>
<p>A small first-aid kit with band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers is always a good idea.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget insect repellent, especially if you&rsquo;re planning on spending time outdoors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a good idea to pack any necessary medications, along with copies of your prescriptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Keep these in your carry-on bag, just in case your luggage gets lost.</p>
<p>And make sure you have travel insurance that covers medical expenses.</p>
<h2 id="dining-out-with-kids-in-france">Dining Out with Kids in France</h2>
<h3 id="family-friendly-restaurants">Family-Friendly Restaurants</h3>
<p>Finding the right restaurant when you&rsquo;re traveling with kids can be a challenge, but France has plenty of options.</p>
