<h2 id="1-calanques-national-park">1. Calanques National Park</h2>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re heading to Marseille? You absolutely HAVE to check out the Calanques National Park. Seriously, it&rsquo;s a game-changer. Just a short distance from the city center, you&rsquo;ll find yourself in a completely different world.</p>
<p><strong>The Calanques are basically a series of stunning limestone cliffs and hidden coves with the bluest water you&rsquo;ve ever seen.</strong> It&rsquo;s like nature decided to show off a little bit.</p>
<p>Think about it: you can spend your day hiking along the <em>scenic</em> trails, each one offering insane views of the coastline. And when you get too hot? Just jump into the crystal-clear water for a swim. There are even secluded beaches where you can just chill and soak up the sun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, the Calanques are a must-see. It&rsquo;s a great escape from the city, and you&rsquo;ll get some amazing photos. Just remember to bring plenty of water and sunscreen, because it can get pretty hot out there, especially during the summer months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are some activities you can do there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiking</li>
<li>Swimming</li>
<li>Sunbathing</li>
<li>Rock Climbing</li>
<li>Boat Tours</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-basilique-notre-dame-de-la-garde">2. Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde</h2>
<p><img src="https://contenu.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/journalist/b9b817c7-2d8b-4080-882c-c37df25835e9/thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Aerial view of Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde in Marseille."></p>
<p>Okay, so Notre-Dame de la Garde is a must-see. Seriously, you can&rsquo;t go to Marseille and miss it. It&rsquo;s perched way up high, so you get, like, the best views ever. I mean, <em>panoramic</em> doesn&rsquo;t even begin to cover it. You can see the whole city, the sea, everything. It&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>The basilica itself is stunning.</strong> It&rsquo;s got this Romanesque-Byzantine style, which basically means it&rsquo;s super ornate and beautiful. The outside is covered in colorful stones and mosaics, and there&rsquo;s this huge statue of the Virgin Mary on top. They call her &ldquo;La Bonne Mère,&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s kind of a symbol of Marseille. It&rsquo;s a great example of <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187253-d230677-Reviews-Basilique_Notre_Dame_de_la_Garde-Marseille_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_.html">religious site</a>.</p>
<p>Inside, it&rsquo;s just as impressive. There are stained glass windows, more mosaics, and a really fancy altar. Plus, the walls are covered in these things called ex-votos. They&rsquo;re like little offerings that people leave to thank the Virgin Mary for miracles. It&rsquo;s all very serene and peaceful, even with the crowds of tourists.</p>
<p>To get up there, you can either climb a bunch of steps (good luck with that in the summer heat) or take a little tourist train. Either way, it&rsquo;s worth the trip. Trust me, the views alone are worth it. And the basilica itself is just amazing. It&rsquo;s one of those places that really sticks with you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, even if you&rsquo;re not religious, Notre-Dame de la Garde is worth visiting. The architecture is incredible, the views are unbeatable, and it&rsquo;s just a really special place. It gives you a sense of the history and culture of Marseille, and it&rsquo;s a great spot to take some amazing photos.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can get crowded, especially during peak season.</li>
<li>Wear comfortable shoes, especially if you&rsquo;re planning to walk up.</li>
<li>Bring your camera – you&rsquo;ll want to take lots of pictures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-old-port-vieux-port">3. Old Port (Vieux Port)</h2>
<p>The Old Port, or <em>Vieux Port</em>, is really the heart of Marseille. It&rsquo;s where the city began, and it&rsquo;s still a bustling spot today. You&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s a great place to just wander around, soak in the atmosphere, and watch the boats. <strong>It&rsquo;s a must-see for any visitor.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the views, though. The Old Port is packed with history. For centuries, it was the main harbor of Marseille, and you can still see remnants of its past all around. Plus, it&rsquo;s the perfect starting point for exploring other parts of the city. You can catch a boat to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187253-d9810205-Reviews-Le_Vieux_Port-Marseille_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html">Frioul islands</a> or even the Calanques National Park right from here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Vieux Port is more than just a pretty place; it&rsquo;s a living, breathing part of Marseille&rsquo;s identity. It&rsquo;s where locals and tourists mingle, where fishermen sell their catch, and where the city&rsquo;s history comes alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab a coffee at one of the many cafes and watch the world go by.</li>
<li>Check out the daily fish market where local fishermen sell their fresh catch.</li>
<li>Take a boat trip to explore the nearby islands and coastline.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-fort-saint-nicolas">4. Fort Saint-Nicolas</h2>
<p>Okay, so Fort Saint-Nicolas. This place has some serious history. It&rsquo;s one of those spots that just oozes stories from centuries ago. You can&rsquo;t miss it; it stands guard right at the entrance to the Old Port.</p>
<p>It was built way back in the 17th century under Louis XIV. But here&rsquo;s the kicker: it wasn&rsquo;t really built to protect Marseille from outside invaders. Nope, it was actually built to keep an eye on the <em>city itself</em> <a href="https://www.marseille-tourisme.com/en/discover-marseille/culture-heritage/fort-saint-nicolas-and-fort-dentrecasteaux-marseille-1er-en-2799639/">Fort Saint-Nicolas</a>. Talk about sending a message, right? <strong>The king wanted to make sure the locals didn&rsquo;t get any ideas about rebelling.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s split into two parts, connected by a causeway. You&rsquo;ve got Fort d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux and Fort Ganteaume. Over time, it&rsquo;s been used for all sorts of things, including a prison. Now, it&rsquo;s more of a historical site. You can wander around, soak up the views, and imagine what life was like back then. It&rsquo;s a pretty cool experience, especially if you&rsquo;re into history or just want to see some amazing architecture.</p>
<h2 id="5-fort-saint-jean">5. Fort Saint-Jean</h2>
<p><img src="https://contenu.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/journalist/63cda350-4d4a-45ed-a881-6d0288e11f27/thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Historic Fort Saint-Jean against the Mediterranean Sea."></p>
<p>Okay, so Fort Saint-Jean. You absolutely have to check this place out. It&rsquo;s not just some old pile of rocks; it&rsquo;s a total time capsule with killer views. Seriously, the views alone are worth the trip. You can see the whole harbor, and it&rsquo;s especially awesome at sunset. Plus, it&rsquo;s connected to Fort Saint-Nicolas by a walkway, so you can knock out two historical sites in one go. How efficient is that?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re there, wander around. There are tons of little nooks and crannies to explore. You&rsquo;ll find gardens, chapels, and even some modern art installations mixed in with the ancient stuff. It&rsquo;s a weird but cool mix. And the best part? It&rsquo;s free to enter! Can&rsquo;t beat that, right? You can spend hours just wandering around and soaking it all in. Don&rsquo;t forget your camera; you&rsquo;ll want to snap a million photos.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the ramparts for panoramic views.</li>
<li>Check out the gardens for a peaceful escape.</li>
<li>Wander through the historical exhibits to learn about the fort&rsquo;s past.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Fort Saint-Jean has a long and interesting history, dating back to the Crusades. It has served as a hospital, a prison, and a military base over the centuries. Today, it stands as a symbol of Marseille&rsquo;s resilience and its connection to the sea.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The fort is a great place to learn about the history of Marseille.</strong> You can easily spend a whole afternoon there, just wandering around and taking in the sights. Plus, it&rsquo;s right next to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187253-d25278344-Reviews-Fort_Saint_jean-Marseille_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html">MuCEM museum</a>, so you can easily combine the two into a full day of exploring. The <em>location</em> is perfect, really. You should definitely add it to your list of must-see places in Marseille.</p>
<h2 id="6-vallon-des-auffes">6. Vallon des Auffes</h2>
<p>Okay, so Vallon des Auffes. It&rsquo;s not just another spot in Marseille; it&rsquo;s like stepping into a postcard. Seriously, this tiny fishing port is so charming it almost feels unreal. You absolutely have to check it out. It&rsquo;s one of those places where you can just wander around, soak up the atmosphere, and forget about everything else for a while.</p>
<p><strong>The vibe is super laid-back</strong>, and it&rsquo;s a total contrast to the busier parts of the city. Think colorful fishing boats bobbing in the water, cute little restaurants with outdoor seating, and the sound of the waves gently crashing against the rocks. It&rsquo;s <em>incredibly</em> picturesque.</p>
<p>One of the best things to do here is grab a bite to eat. There are several restaurants specializing in seafood, and you really can&rsquo;t go wrong with anything you order. Fresh fish, mussels, bouillabaisse – it&rsquo;s all delicious. Just imagine sitting outside, enjoying a glass of wine, and watching the sunset over the Mediterranean. Sounds pretty good, right? You can find some great <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g187253-Activities-zft12156-Marseille_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html">dining options</a> here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great place to take photos, too. The light is amazing, and there are so many interesting angles and perspectives to play with. Whether you&rsquo;re a professional photographer or just snapping some pics with your phone, you&rsquo;re sure to get some amazing shots.</p></blockquote>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re feeling adventurous, you can even go for a swim. There are a few small beaches and coves where you can take a dip in the crystal-clear water. Just be careful of the rocks, and make sure to wear appropriate footwear.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wander around the port and admire the fishing boats.</li>
<li>Have lunch or dinner at one of the seafood restaurants.</li>
<li>Take some photos of the picturesque scenery.</li>
<li>Go for a swim in the Mediterranean Sea.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-corniche-kennedy">7. Corniche Kennedy</h2>
<p><img src="https://contenu.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/journalist/8f2d8fd9-93c5-4326-a785-0dddb2a2a51d/thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Scenic view of Corniche Kennedy in Marseille, France."></p>
<p>Imagine yourself strolling along the Corniche Kennedy, one of Marseille&rsquo;s most iconic coastal roads. It stretches for about 5 kilometers, offering breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea. <strong>This scenic route is perfect for a leisurely walk, jog, or bike ride.</strong></p>
<p>As you make your way along the Corniche, you&rsquo;ll pass by several beaches and coves. It&rsquo;s a great spot to stop for a swim or simply relax and soak up the sun. The Corniche is also home to numerous restaurants and cafes, where you can enjoy a meal or a drink with a view. You can easily explore the <a href="https://www.foratravel.com/the-journal/things-to-do-in-marseille-france">shallow coastal waters</a> and discover the <em>hidden gems</em> along the way.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><img src="https://contenu.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/journalist/44db27ba-8b9d-4dcb-9b26-5078ef1c8943/thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Exterior view of MuCEM with Mediterranean backdrop."></p>
<p>Okay, so MuCEM. It&rsquo;s not just another museum; it&rsquo;s like a deep dive into the cultures that have shaped Europe and the Mediterranean. Inaugurated in 2013 when Marseille was the European Capital of Culture, the building itself is a sight to behold. Designed by Rudy Ricciotti, the concrete latticework facade is super striking. You can&rsquo;t miss it right on the waterfront, connected to Fort Saint-Jean by a footbridge.</p>
<p>Inside, you&rsquo;ll find a ton of stuff – archaeological finds, art, photos, and all sorts of ethnographic objects. The exhibits cover everything from religion and trade to migration and cultural exchange. It&rsquo;s all about showing how interconnected these regions are. <strong>It&rsquo;s a really cool way to spend an afternoon, especially if you&rsquo;re into <em>history</em> and culture.</strong></p>
<p>Besides the main exhibits, MuCEM also has temporary exhibitions and events. These delve into specific themes or artists, offering a fresh perspective each time you visit. They also host lectures, film screenings, and performances, so there&rsquo;s always something going on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MuCEM isn&rsquo;t just about looking at old stuff; it&rsquo;s about fostering a dialogue between different cultures. They partner with other institutions and universities to promote research and knowledge exchange. Plus, they have educational programs for everyone, no matter your age.</p></blockquote>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget the Mediterranean garden! It&rsquo;s a chill spot to relax, take a stroll, and enjoy the sea views. It&rsquo;s a nice break from being inside and a great way to soak up the Mediterranean vibe.</p>
<h2 id="9-rade-de-marseille">9. Rade de Marseille</h2>
<p>The <em>Rade de Marseille</em>, or Bay of Marseille, is a sight you absolutely can&rsquo;t miss. It&rsquo;s more than just a body of water; it&rsquo;s the heart of the city&rsquo;s maritime soul.
