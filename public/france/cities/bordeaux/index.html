<h2 id="15-rue-sainte-catherine">15. Rue Sainte-Catherine</h2>
<p>Okay, so Rue Sainte-Catherine is basically <em>the</em> shopping street in Bordeaux. I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to miss. After you&rsquo;re done checking out the Grosse Cloche, just keep going down Cours d’Alsace-et-Lorraine, and bam, you&rsquo;re there. It&rsquo;s super long, pedestrian-only, and packed with shops. You can find pretty much anything you&rsquo;re looking for here, from clothes to cosmetics. It&rsquo;s a bit of a madhouse, especially on weekends, but it&rsquo;s worth checking out, even if just for the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Rue Sainte-Catherine is the longest pedestrian street in France.</strong></p>
<p>Think of it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>South End (near Place de la Victoire):</strong> Budget-friendly clothing stores. Great if you&rsquo;re looking for a bargain.</li>
<li><strong>North End:</strong> Big chain stores. All the usual suspects are here.</li>
<li><strong>Middle (Place Saint Projet):</strong> A good spot to take a break and people-watch. Grab a coffee or a snack.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, sometimes it feels like everyone in Bordeaux is on this street at the same time. But hey, that&rsquo;s part of the charm, right? Just be prepared for crowds and maybe wear comfortable shoes. You&rsquo;ll be doing a lot of walking.</p></blockquote>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve had your fill of shopping, you can head over to Place Pey Berland to see the main <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g187079-Activities-c47-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html">Bordeaux Cathedral</a>. It&rsquo;s not too far from Rue Sainte-Catherine, and it&rsquo;s a nice change of pace from all the hustle and bustle.

You can easily spend a whole afternoon here, just wandering around and soaking up the atmosphere. It&rsquo;s a great place for families, couples, or even just solo travelers who need a bit of peace and quiet.</p>

<h2 id="19-pont-de-pierre">19. Pont de Pierre</h2>
<p>Okay, so Pont de Pierre, or the Stone Bridge, is kind of a big deal in Bordeaux. It&rsquo;s not just some bridge; it&rsquo;s <em>the</em> bridge that Napoleon ordered to be built way back when. Seriously, it&rsquo;s been around since 1822! It&rsquo;s the oldest bridge in Bordeaux, and it connects the left and right banks of the Garonne River. You&rsquo;ll probably end up walking across it at some point, and it&rsquo;s worth it for the views alone.</p>
<p><strong>The bridge offers stunning panoramic views of the city skyline.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty cool piece of history, and it&rsquo;s still super functional. Plus, it looks great in photos, especially at sunset.
