<p><img src="/imgs/spain/surf-lanzada.webp" alt="Surfers riding waves at Playa de la Lanzada beach."></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find that this beach offers a unique blend of <em>adventure</em> and tranquility.</p>

<h2 id="21-playa-de-la-catedrales---unique-coastal-landscape">21. Playa de la Catedrales - Unique Coastal Landscape</h2>
<p>Okay, so maybe you&rsquo;re not <em>just</em> here to surf.</p>
<p>Maybe you want a little something <em>extra</em> with your wave-riding adventure.</p>
<p>Well, have I got a spot for you! Playa de las Catedrales, or &ldquo;Beach of the Cathedrals,&rdquo; in Galicia is less about the waves (though you can find some) and more about the mind-blowing scenery.</p>
<p>Seriously, this place is unreal.</p>
<p><strong>The main draw here isn&rsquo;t the surf, it&rsquo;s the incredible rock formations.</strong> Over thousands of years, the ocean has carved these massive arches and caves into the cliffs, making it look like, well, a bunch of cathedrals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like nature&rsquo;s own architectural masterpiece.</p>
<p>You can even book a <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g609028-d1547522-Reviews-Playa_de_las_Catedrales-Ribadeo_Province_of_Lugo_Galicia.html">private tour</a> to experience the beauty of Catedrales Beach.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the thing: you usually need a permit to visit during peak season (summer and Semana Santa).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free, but they limit the number of people to protect the area.</p>
<p>So, plan ahead and book your spot online.</p>
<p>Trust me, it&rsquo;s worth the extra step.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stunning views, especially at low tide when you can walk among the arches.</li>
<li>Photo opportunities galore. Seriously, your Instagram will thank you.</li>
<li>A chance to explore the Galician coast beyond just the surf.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a heads up: check the tide times before you go. You can only really explore the beach at low tide High tide? The &ldquo;cathedrals&rdquo; are mostly underwater. Still pretty, but not quite the same experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re looking for a surf trip with a side of natural wonder, Playa de las Catedrales is a must-see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit different from your typical surf spot, but that&rsquo;s what makes it so special.</p>
